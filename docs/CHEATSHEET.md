## Tips

- **Be specific** — "Create a student list with search, filters, and a table" works better than "Create a list"
- **One thing at a time** — Claude builds incrementally, so you'll see progress after each piece
- **Review often** — Catch issues early by checking after each addition
- **Wrap up sessions** — Say "let's wrap up" to ensure status is captured before ending
