## Section 5

**Section Label:**
Eyes Wide Open

**Headline:**
What This Requires

**Subhead:**
This is achievable, but not without investment and commitment.

**Body Copy:**

**Talent investment**
The people who can do this work are scarce and command premium compensation. Leading companies are already making this investment. We'll need to do the same.

**Pioneer territory**
This isn't widely adopted yet. We'll be on the leading edge—which means we'll make mistakes and learn as we go. Initial steps may feel uncomfortable. Not everyone will adapt.

**Velocity initially outpaces quality**
LLMs struggle to produce UI that fits within existing products—exactly what enterprise software requires. Using this approach will create some debt. But the technology is improving rapidly—this gap will close soon.

Start now, and we're ready when it arrives. Wait for "ready," and we're behind.

**Organizational commitment**
This is a 6-12 month transformation, not an overnight switch. It requires patience through the bumpy early phase.

**Closing Callout:**
The risk of moving forward is real. But the cost of standing still is higher.

Competitors who adopt this model will outpace those who don't. The market is already shifting—layoffs, restructuring, and the flattening of traditional roles signal this is happening now.

The question isn't whether to change. It's whether we lead or react.
